DE9A.java, DE9C.java, DE9E.java, and DE9F.java implements AES with CBC, CFB, OFB, and CTR modes of operation.  Complete DE9B.java as a CBC decoder and DE9D.java as a CFB decoder.  Show that you can decode ciphertext encrypted with these four modes. DE9A/B has stallingskey hard coded in the program.  DE9C/D requires the command line "java DE9D stallingskey.txt < DE9Dtest1" to run the CFB decoder.  DE9E/F run like "java DE9E stallingskey.txt nonce.txt < DE9Etest1".  (DE9A.java, DE9C.java, DE9E.java, and DE9F.java can be fetched from Module 2/17/2023.)
